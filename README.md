# SV Dashboard for Home Assistant

A HACS custom integration that builds a multilingual, vehicle-focused Home Assistant experience on top of [Stellantis Vehicles](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles).

Current stable package version: **0.5.53**.

[![Open the SV Dashboard repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=CaneTLOTW&repository=sv_dashboard&category=integration)

Install this repository as an **Integration**, not as a standalone Lovelace dashboard card repository.

## What it provides

- A Home Assistant config flow that discovers a configured Stellantis vehicle and maps its entities dynamically; no VIN-derived entity IDs or copied household YAML are required.
- One generated SV Dashboard per config entry with dedicated **Vehicle**, **Charging**, **Statistics**, **Trips**, **GPS**, **Wake-up**, **Notifications**, and **System** views.
- A reusable compact card, `custom:sv-dashboard-vehicle-overview-card`, for an existing home page or mobility dashboard.
- Canonical Stellantis trip history with server-history refresh, data-quality guards and continuity repair without rewriting retained raw source rows.
- Persistent charging history with observed sessions, reconstructed SOC/time curves and explicit distinction between observed values and battery-side estimates.
- GPS history combining Home Assistant Recorder data, canonical Stellantis start/stop history and the current vehicle position.
- Derived metrics such as trailing consumption over approximately 500 km and distance since the last charge.
- Home Assistant long-term-statistics views for available mileage/SOH data without silently rewriting malformed historical statistics.
- Optional notifications, explicit recipient opt-in, configurable warning thresholds, quiet hours and reachability diagnostics.
- Wake-up/reachability controls with conservative recovery semantics: an accepted or forwarded command is not treated as fresh vehicle data.
- German and English integration/frontend strings.
- Multi-vehicle support: each config entry owns its mapping, package state and generated dashboard.

## Compact vehicle overview card

The package also registers a compact card through the same frontend entry point. It can be placed on an existing Home Assistant start page or mobility dashboard without opening the full SV Dashboard.

```yaml
type: custom:sv-dashboard-vehicle-overview-card
```

With one configured e-C3 entry the card is zero-config. With multiple entries, bind the card to a specific config entry with `entry_id`.

The generated Vehicle/LIVE hero uses the same canonical card implementation (`variant: live`), so the home-page card and full dashboard share the same entity mapping, vehicle-image lifecycle and primary status semantics.

See [Vehicle overview card](docs/VEHICLE_OVERVIEW_CARD.md) for optional navigation, heading and multi-vehicle configuration.

## Requirements

The integration currently targets Home Assistant **2026.5.0 or later** and validates against the Stellantis Vehicles integration baseline defined by the package.

Install and configure these dependencies first:

1. [Stellantis Vehicles](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles)
2. [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card)
3. [Button Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
4. [ha-map-card](https://github.com/nathan-gs/ha-map-card)
5. [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)

The Stellantis integration must already expose a real vehicle with battery, mileage and tracker entities. Downloading the upstream repository without completing its login/vehicle setup is not enough.

See [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.en.md) for the full setup and troubleshooting flow.

## Dashboard structure and screenshots

The generated dashboard is organized by task instead of collecting every vehicle entity in one page:

| View | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Vehicle** | Current vehicle state, LIVE hero, current charging/range/climate, latest trip/charge and quick actions. |
| **Charging** | Completed charging sessions and reconstructed historical charge curves. |
| **Statistics** | Aggregated/long-term metrics such as mileage, driven distance, SOH and trailing consumption. |
| **Trips** | Canonical driving history, filters, data-quality handling and server-history refresh. |
| **GPS** | Date/range-based position history plus the separate current vehicle marker. |
| **Wake-up** | Manual/optional reachability controls and remote-connection state. |
| **Notifications** | Explicit recipient controls, notification topics, thresholds, quiet hours and diagnostics. |
| **System** | Integration/runtime administration and mapped upstream diagnostics. |

Detailed trip, charge and GPS history is intentionally kept out of the Vehicle view. Vehicle stays the day-to-day cockpit; history and administration have their own views.

All screenshots below are current, anonymized runtime examples. Location/map content, history rows, recipients and private integration identifiers are omitted or covered by opaque redaction.

### Vehicle / LIVE

Vehicle / LIVE is the day-to-day cockpit. Its hero uses the same canonical vehicle-overview implementation as the portable start-page card and presents range, contextual temperature or charging information, SOC/battery state, remote connectivity and preconditioning quick actions.

The remainder of the view concentrates on the **current** vehicle picture: usage/consumption, mileage, charging/range state, high-voltage battery health, 12-V/service-battery information, current position and the latest trip and charge. Vehicle and maintenance details share one popup. Historical trip, charging and GPS exploration is intentionally delegated to the dedicated views below.

![LIVE vehicle view](docs/assets/vehicle-live.png)

### Charging

Charging is the dedicated history view for completed AC/DC sessions. A session can be selected and, where source data permits, the view presents start/end SOC, duration, energy and average charging power together with a reconstructed SOC/time curve.

The curve is derived from vehicle-side history. It is useful for comparing sessions, but it is not a meter-grade wallbox power trace and should not be read as one.

![Historical e-C3 charging curves](docs/assets/charging-history.png)

### Statistics

Statistics contains the aggregated metrics rather than individual trip rows. It shows available battery SOH capacity/resistance information, mileage, driven distance and the trailing consumption over approximately 500 km where the required history is available.

Distance charts use Home Assistant long-term statistics. The dashboard does not silently rewrite malformed stored statistics; a pre-existing statistics reset or discontinuity can remain visible until it is repaired through a supported Home Assistant statistics path.

![e-C3 long-term statistics](docs/assets/statistics.png)

### Trips

Trips is the dedicated driving-history view. It uses the canonical server-history layer, provides an explicit server-history refresh and supports filtering, including zero-distance and short-trip handling.

Plausibility checks keep unusable records out of downstream metrics. If an upstream trip contains an implausible odometer boundary, the derived canonical boundary is repaired only when there is strong continuity evidence. The raw upstream record remains unchanged for diagnostics; if evidence is insufficient, the record remains invalid instead of inventing a distance.

![Trip history with private rows redacted](docs/assets/trips-history.png)

### GPS

GPS is separated from the compact current-position information in Vehicle. The history view supports Today, Yesterday, a native Home Assistant date/range selector and All, and can combine Recorder points with canonical Stellantis server history.

The current vehicle position remains a distinct live marker instead of being silently appended as another archived history point. The public screenshot therefore deliberately redacts map and position data.

![GPS history with map and position redacted](docs/assets/gps-history.png)

### Wake-up

Wake-up contains the vehicle-reachability controls: manual wake-up, hourly wake-up, wake-up while charging and the optional reachability probe.

The recovery semantics are deliberately conservative. A remote command reported as `accepted` or `forwarded` only confirms command handling; only fresh, trustworthy vehicle data counts as a recovered heartbeat.

![Wake-up controls](docs/assets/wakeup.png)

### Notifications

Notifications is the dedicated communication-policy view. It contains the master switch, vehicle warnings, trip and charging reports, explicit opt-in recipients, recipient management, test notifications, warning/reset thresholds, reachability/probe parameters, charging-start delay, quiet hours and diagnostics.

Notify-service discovery only makes a recipient available for selection. It never activates that recipient automatically, and installation itself sends no notification.

![Notification switches without recipient rows](docs/assets/notifications.png)

### System

System contains integration and operational administration that does not belong in the everyday vehicle cockpit: setup/connection status, detected upstream entities, privacy/data-sharing state, refresh interval, battery-value correction and ABRP controls/status where configured.

Keeping these controls here is part of the current view structure: **Vehicle** stays focused on the car, while **System** explains and controls how the e-C3 integration is operating.

![System controls](docs/assets/system.png)

### Integration, entities and configuration

The Home Assistant integration/device view is the technical companion to the generated dashboard. Each e-C3 config entry maps the selected upstream vehicle and its entities dynamically instead of embedding a VIN or household-specific entity IDs in dashboard source.

Initial vehicle/module selection and explicit notification opt-in happen through the config flow. Later entry-level changes are available through Home Assistant options; ongoing runtime/operational controls are exposed in **System**. With multiple vehicles, each config entry remains independent and owns its generated dashboard.

![Integration and entity overview with private identifiers redacted](docs/assets/integration-entities.png)

For more detail, see [Dashboard features](docs/DASHBOARD_FEATURES.md), the [entity catalog](docs/ENTITY_CATALOG.md) and the [vehicle overview card guide](docs/VEHICLE_OVERVIEW_CARD.md).

## Frontend architecture

Home Assistant registers exactly **one package-owned Lovelace resource**:

```text
/sv_dashboard/frontend.js
```

`frontend.js` imports the package-owned strategy and card modules as ES modules. Historical e-C3 resource URLs from older versions are retained only as migration cleanup targets; users should not manually register the old resources.

A frontend change increments the package frontend/cache version so Home Assistant and browsers do not keep serving an older module graph.

## Data ownership and quality

The project has a strict boundary:

- **Stellantis Vehicles** owns authentication, upstream polling/API access, native vehicle entities and remote commands.
- **SV Dashboard** reads only the selected upstream device, creates its own derived/canonical data and never calls the Stellantis API directly.
- **Canonical server history** keeps retained trip/charge history and quality metadata. Raw source values are not overwritten merely to make a row look plausible.
- **Home Assistant Recorder** remains the source for local state history such as detailed tracker history and other HA-side history windows.
- **Package stores** hold restart-safe local sessions, canonical history and notification/wake-up state per config entry.

Energy, charge-power and consumption values derived from SOC/time are estimates, not billing-grade measurements. The UI and entity attributes keep that distinction explicit.

An existing malformed Home Assistant long-term-statistics segment is also not silently hidden. The current open LTS repair work is tracked in [Issue #25](https://github.com/CaneTLOTW/sv_dashboard/issues/25).

See [Entity catalog and data quality](docs/ENTITY_CATALOG.md).

## Notifications and wake-up

Notifications are opt-in at every layer:

1. choose recipients in the integration options;
2. enable the notification master switch;
3. enable the desired topic switch;
4. enable the selected recipient switch.

Warning/reset thresholds, delays and quiet hours are package-owned Home Assistant entities. Reachability uses a proven fresh vehicle heartbeat rather than treating arbitrary unchanged telemetry as connection proof. `accepted`/`forwarded` command status alone is not recovery evidence.

The source implementation is complete; focused real-event QA remains tracked in [Issue #23](https://github.com/CaneTLOTW/sv_dashboard/issues/23).

See [Notifications and wake-up](docs/NOTIFICATIONS_AND_WAKEUP.en.md).

## Remote capabilities

The upstream integration can expose generic remote-command entities even when a specific vehicle does not support the corresponding physical action. The dashboard therefore does not equate “entity exists” with “vehicle capability confirmed”.

For the tested ë-C3 behavior and the distinction between upstream entity availability, command lifecycle and observed vehicle effect, see the [ë-C3 capability matrix](docs/STELLANTIS_EC3_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.en.md).

If ordinary telemetry works but remote-oriented entities suddenly become unavailable, first verify the Stellantis Vehicles authentication/session before changing e-C3 mappings.

## Development and release flow

Development happens on `develop`. `main` is the last accepted publishable state. Runtime acceptance may intentionally run an exact `develop` SHA; only the exact validated SHA is fast-forwarded to `main` after maintainer/user acceptance.

See [Branch and deployment workflow](docs/BRANCH_AND_DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md), [Release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Support and privacy

Use [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) and [Community guidance](docs/COMMUNITY.en.md) for setup/questions and reporting rules.

Do not publish VINs, account/customer IDs, exact locations, GPS tracks, Notify recipient names, credentials, tokens or raw Home Assistant `.storage`/Store exports. Public screenshots in this repository are intentionally anonymized with opaque redaction.
